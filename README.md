# San-Fran-PropTech-Mod-6

This is a Project that takes in real-estate data from SanFransisco 2010-2016 and plots it graphically using Hvplots.

First it looks at the growth in housing units for the period using a bar graph to demonstrate this

Then it compares average rental prices and sales values by square foot for the neighborhoods and shows these using interactive displays.
